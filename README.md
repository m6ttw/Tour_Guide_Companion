This is an app made for tour guides to share handy tips with each other using Google Maps

The map is pre-populated with some starter data in the form of markers which show up on the map

A user can add markers to the map which are then saved to a database, and also edit and delete markers

Clicking a marker shows details the user has given such as the category e.g. toilets, parking spots and also some notes if they have added them
